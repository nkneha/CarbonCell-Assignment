 Spring Security with JWT
 API Data Management And Retrieve Ethereum Account Balance

## 📝 Description
This project is a web application built using Java and leveraging several frameworks and technologies for efficient development and seamless user experience. It utilizes Spring Boot for streamlined setup and configuration, 
following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern for clear separation of concerns.<br />
The application focuses on providing robust user authentication mechanisms, ensuring secure user sessions throughout the browsing experience.
External API integration is facilitated to retrieve necessary data, enhancing the application's functionality and usability.

## ✨ Key Features
* **User Registration and Authentication:**
  - Secure endpoints for user registration and login, providing JWTs for authenticated sessions.

* **JWT Validation:**
  - Each request is processed through a JWT authentication filter, ensuring the token's validity before granting access to protected resources.

* **Custom Logout Mechanism:**
  - A secure logout process that invalidates the user's JWT, ensuring a safe termination of the session.

* **Swagger Integration:**
  - Interactive API documentation powered by Swagger, allowing users to understand, explore, and test the API endpoints directly from the browser.
